# MockingBird

 
WHAT I LEARNED


Persistent data using Realm: 

• Create, read, update and delete data (CRUD)

• Implement a search bar and query data

• Pass data backward from the Popup ViewController using delegates and protocols

• Set constraints using Auto Layout

• Use Swift closures

• Choose images with UIImagePickerController
